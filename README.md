# COVID-19-Mobility
Studying the effect of COVID-19 on people's mobility in the US
This projects provides information on the distribution of the percentage change in mobility across the US from March, 1st 2020 until the date when the most recent data is available. How the mobility changes in the US are visualized on this [dashboard app](https://iawad.shinyapps.io/COVID-MOBILITY-2020/). Trends of the reported new cases and the percentage of mobility change are also available. Also the effect of the daily cases on the mobility has been also reported. The same data is also available for the NYC area counties.

This [blog](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/effect-of-covid-19-on-our-mobility/) has more details on the outcome of the study.
